Assignment 2 of the TuteDude Python Course

# Task 1:
The program checks whether a number is even or odd using the following logic:
- If a number `n` is divisible by 2, it is even, if not, then it is odd.
- We check this by using the expression `n % 2 == 0`.
At the end we display the result to the output terminal.

# Task 2:
The program calculates the sum of all the integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. In each loop cycle, the variable `sum` initialized by 0 is updated by adding the value of the looping variable `i` to the previous value of `sum`. This adds all the integers from 1 to 50 and gives us the required answer, 1275. This answer is then displayed on the output terminal.
